# MarkLogic Case Design


## Internal fields

## Application fields

## Pre-defined or ad-hoc activities and phases

How MarkLogic Case supports both mechanisms.

## Integration with Workflow

Find case (E.g. by ID/search)
Create case
Attach case to process
Detach case from process
Update case (with reassign) (Is Complete Activity the same or separate?)
Close case
Attach to case
Detach from case

Primary Case (for current process instance)
